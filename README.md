I'm doing my PhD on psycholinguistics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). I'm interested in language acquisition, bilingualism, and statistics. I use R regularly to process, analyse, and sometimes collect data. Do not hesitate to get in contact at gonzaloggc95@gmail.com or by Twitter ([@gongcastro](https://twitter.com/gongcastro))!

You can also take a look at some code snippets I made at my Gists profile: https://gist.github.com/gongcastro.
